Argo CD Notifications continuously monitors Argo CD applications and provides a flexible way to notify users about important changes in the application state. Using a flexible mechanism of triggers and templates you can configure when the notification should be sent as well as notification content. Argo CD Notifications includes the catalog of useful triggers and templates. So you can just use them instead of reinventing new ones.
